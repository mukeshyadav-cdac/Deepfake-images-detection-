Deepfake uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), a deep learning method to create high-quality fake images and videos, this is possible today due to advances of hardware and the availability of data. Contents created by Deepfake are hard to distinguish with real ones; therefore, it is a major problem in todayâ€™s era of fake news. In this paper, we survey datasets used for detecting Deepfake contents. In addition to that, we will also perform Deepfake fake face images detection by using our custom CNN model, MobileNet model and pre-trained MobileNet model on ImageNet using Transfer Learning. We will try to find the answer whether a MobileNet model would produce enough accuracy to classify images generated from GAN.
